                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong><small>Where I'm From</small></strong>
                <p>I was born and raised in Washington State in a town called  Wenatchee, just 3 hours away from Seattle. I grew up living right next to the mountains and loved doing outdoor activities as a kid. I would do a lot of outdoor camping in the woods, go hiking and during the winter go skiing. When I turned 13 my family moved to San Jose, California. Around that time my friends in Cali introduced me to console gaming, because they would always play online together, and I’ve been invested into videogames ever since. After living in California for a year we eventually moved to Florida, where I currently live. I absolutely fell in love with the beaches and the always sunny weather, besides the sun burns. I’ve lived here for about 8 years now and plan on remaining here, although I still miss the mountains.</p>
                <strong><small>Sports</small></strong>
                <p>I’ve always been active, but never gravitated to any sports until I got to high school. The first sport that I fell in love with was cross-country. I became a very fast long distance runner and eventually became the captain of my high school team. I also participated in track, running the long distance races. That being said, no other sport called out to as much as wrestling. I started my freshman year, originally planning on just trying it out for a week since my cross-country coach said he thought I would do good. It was one of the most difficult trainings I’ve ever done at the time and I was hooked. I won my first varsity tournament the second week of joining the team. Eventually placing at districts at the end of the year. I continued to train on the off-season and became the captain of the team my Junior year, eventually becoming one of the top high school wrestlers in  Florida, in my weight class. The martial arts will always have my heart and I plan on starting my journey in Brazilian Jujitsu soon.</p>

                <strong><small>Travel</small></strong>
                <p>I love traveling and my goal is to travel somewhere new every year. I’ve been to many of the states such as New York, Colorado, Oregon, Texas, and more. I’ve been to Cancun, Mexico and visited the Aztec temples. I’ve been to South America a few times in Brazil and Argentina. I love to experience other cultures and I cant wait for my next adventure. A few places on my bucket list is Japan, Spain, Italy, Costa Rica, and Switzerland </p>
                <strong><small>My Education</small></strong>
                <p>After graduating high school I went to college at the University of Central Florida located in Orlando. I originally planned on majoring in aerospace engineering. After about two years in college and getting further along in my field I came to realize that aerospace wasn’t the right field for me. Although I was doing good in my studies I would have conversations with other people who were already in the field and realized it just wasn’t the right fit for me. I managed to complete my AA degree at UCF and am now studying to be a web developer here at coding temple.</p>

                <h1>Why I Want To Be A Web Developer</h1>
                <strong><small>I Like Solving Problems Creatively</small></strong>
                <p>I never really thought too much about web development until I took a class in my college as a prerequisite for my degree. I ended up really enjoying the class even though it was challenging. I am a problem solver and love trying to solve puzzles. Coding had a lot of problem solving and being able to realize and learn how to solve specific problems to make your code run became fun, as frustrating as it can be sometimes. The other really cool part is the amount of creative freedom you have when coding. You can create so much with lines of code and when I realized how much code is used in everything we do it blew my mind. I want to be able to learn multiple languages and master a few so that I can create some awesome projects with my skills. It also is a plus that web developers make some good money if they know what they are doing, and the job satisfaction is really high. I already can tell this is the path for me and I’m exited for this new adventure.</p>
